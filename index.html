           <h2>“If Allah wants to do good to somebody, he afflicts him with trials.” – Sahih Al Bukhari</h2>
           <h3 class="text-highlighter">“ A good man treats women with honour.” Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)</h3>

           <p>
            According to the Islamic statement of witness, or shahada, “There is no god but Allah”. Muslims believe he created the world in six days and sent prophets such as Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, Jesus, and lastly Muhammad, who called people to worship only him, rejecting idolatry and polytheism.

The word islam, which means submission, was not at first the name of a religion founded by Muhammad. It referred, rather, to the original religion of all mankind – and even of the universe itself which, like us, was created to serve Allah

        <h2>About Mohammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam</h2>
        <h3 class="text-highlighter">Be kind, for whenever kindness becomes part of something, it beautifies it. </h3>

        <p>
            Muhammad was the prophet and founder of Islam. Most of his early life was spent as a merchant. At age 40, he began to have revelations from Allah that became the basis for the Koran and the foundation of Islam. By 630 he had unified most of Arabia under a single religion. As of 2015, there are over 1.8 billion Muslims in the world who profess, “There is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is his prophet.”
